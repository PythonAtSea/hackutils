# hackUtils

![cover](image.png)

this is a collection of simple, web based, adfree utilites. Everything is written in typescript using Next.JS. if you have a suggestion, you can reach me on the [hackclub slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U078RA454JH) if you're under 18, or through github issues. everything is deliberately very simple, and designed to get the job done in the simplest way possible as quickly as possible.

## new in v0.2

lotta bug fixes. also immersive mode, light/dark mode, and hidden sidebar mode. i also made the countdown thing actually work. also, a lot of stuff is just more polished. no new utils tho, just wanted to work on getting stuff to work better.

## running locally

this is just a basic next.js app, you can figure it out i'm sure.
